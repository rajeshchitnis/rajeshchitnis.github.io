<h2>Ideas for Student Projects </h2>

<ol>
  	<li>
		<b>Understand the theoretical definitions of important real-world problems. Then design simple heuristics for these (typically) hard problems and see how they perform on real-world datasets.</b>
		<br>
		Some examples of such problems are
			<ul>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_k-center">k-Center</a>: The simple greedy algorithm gives 2-approximation. How does this work on real-world (or random) datasets?
				<br>					
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a>: This <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/3237383.3237429">paper</a> discusses a greedy algorithm 
				<br>
				
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover">Vertex Cover</a>: The simple greedy algorithm gives 2-approximation. How does this work on real-world data sets?		
			</ul>

	</li>

		<br>
	<li>
		<b>Build your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT solver</a>  </b>
		<br>
		You can test performance of your SAT solver on standard datasets, and use it to try to solve real-world problems like UoB timetabling.
	</li>

		<br>

	<li>
		<b>Implement known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm">(stable) matching</a> algorithms  </b>
		<br>
		You will learn about these algorithms, implement and use them for real-world problems like allocating students to project supervisors. We've actually used one such algorithm for the allocation this year!
	</li>

		<br>
	<li>
		<b>Visualization of algorithms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm">streaming algorithms</a> on large datasets  </b>
		<br>
		You will learn about how to implement known algorithms (graphs, sorting, etc.) and then how to visualize them. Here is one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc">example</a> of such a project.
	</li>

		<br>

	<li>
		<b>Implement known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm">streaming algorithms</a> on large datasets  </b>
		<br>
		You will learn about streaming algorithms, and how to implement them on large datasets
	</li>

		<br>

	<li>
		<b>Difficult:</b> Design (and implement) new, improved algorithms
		<br>
		This projects will be theoretical, and you must have strong background in algorithms/mathematics/complexity theory for these types of projects.
	</li>

		<br>	

	<li>
		<b>Ideas suggested by students  </b>
		<br>
		I am happy to consider other topics, as long as they are related to algorithms.
	</li>
